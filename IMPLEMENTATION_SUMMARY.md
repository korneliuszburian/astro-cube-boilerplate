# Implementation Summary - Dot For You E-commerce

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Dynamic Route Error
- **Problem**: `/products/[id].astro` was empty and causing `GetStaticPathsRequired` error
- **Solution**: 
  - Deleted old `[id].astro` file
  - Created new `/products/[slug].astro` with proper `getStaticPaths`
  - Implemented full product detail page with all features
  - Uses slug-based routing instead of ID

### 2. Added Modern View Transitions (Astro 5.x)
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `experimental.viewTransitions` to `astro.config.mjs`
  - `ViewTransitions` component already in `Layout.astro`
  - Added `ViewTransitions` to shop and product pages
  - Implemented `transition:name` for product images for smooth animations

### 3. Enhanced Shop Page with Filters

### 4. Updated Product Data Structure
- **Categories in use**:

- All 12 products currently have:
  - Generic names (Pants #1-12)
  - Same price (350 ZŁ)
  - Empty stories
  - You may want to add unique descriptions later

- Product categories are properly distributed:
  - Check `getCategoryCounts()` for actual distribution
  - Categories can be extended in `types.ts` if needed

## 🚀 Running the Project

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

The dynamic route error should be gone, and the shop now has full filtering capability!
